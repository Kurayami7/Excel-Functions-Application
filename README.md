# Excel Functions with GUI using Java Swing
This is a simple Java Swing application that provides basic Excel-like functionality to calculate statistics (sum, average, maximum, and minimum) on a list of numbers. The program is designed to accept user input, process the data, and display the results based on the selected operation.

# How It Works
User Input: Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces in the input field.

Choose Operation: Select the desired operation (Sum, Average, Maximum, or Minimum) using the radio buttons.

Calculate: Click the "Calculate" button to perform the chosen operation.

Result Display: The result will be displayed in the "Result" field.

# Code Structure
The application consists of three main Java classes:

Excel: This class handles the processing of user input and contains methods for calculating the total, average, maximum, and minimum values of the provided numbers.

Main: The main class initializes the Swing event window where the user interacts with the application.

SwingEventWindow: This class extends JFrame and implements event listeners to create the graphical user interface. It includes input fields, radio buttons for selecting the operation, and a button to trigger the calculations.

# How to Run
To run this Java Swing application, you need to compile and execute the Main class. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to input numbers and select the desired operation.
